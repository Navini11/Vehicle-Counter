## üìÑ Contents

- `License Plate Detection.py`: A script for detecting and recognizing license plates on vehicles.
- `Vehicle Counting in Lanes.py`: A script for detecting and counting vehicles in specified lanes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Other dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Scripts

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Navini11/vehicle-counter.git
    cd vehicle-counter
    ```

2. **Run the Vehicle Counting Script:**
    ```bash
    python Vehicle Counting in Lanes.py
    ```

3. **Run the License Plate Detection Script:**
    ```bash
    python License Plate Detection.py
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

### Vehicle Counting

The `Vehicle Counting in Lanes.py` script performs the following steps:
1. **Load Video Feed:** Loads a video stream for vehicle detection.
2. **Preprocessing:** Applies preprocessing techniques such as resizing and grayscale conversion.
3. **Vehicle Detection:** Uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect vehicles in each frame.
4. **Lane Assignment:** Assigns detected vehicles to specific lanes based on their positions.
5. **Counting:** Counts the number of vehicles in each lane and updates the count in real-time.

### License Plate Detection

The `License Plate Detection.py` script includes:
1. **Load Image/Video Feed:** Loads an image or video stream containing vehicles.
2. **Preprocessing:** Applies preprocessing techniques such as resizing and grayscale conversion.
3. **License Plate Detection:** Uses OpenCV to detect license plates on vehicles.
4. **Recognition:** Recognizes the characters on the detected license plates using OCR.

## üìö Technologies Used

- **Software:**
  - TensorFlow
